__Assumptions.__ Suppose the researchers wanted at least 80% statistical power to capture a difference of 2 pg/ml or more. That is, they wanted to ensure that if there was in deed a true difference of 2 pg/ml between the two groups then the experiment would detect and conclude a significant difference with a probability of 80%. Futher assume the observed standard deviation is a good estimate for the true standard deviation.

__Power analysis.__ Using at 5% significance level, we can conduct a power analysis to compute the required sample size in R as shown on the right. Based on the result, it's recommended to recruit at least `r ceiling(pa1$n)` participants per treatment, or `r ceiling(pa1$n) * 2` in total.

## Example answers to question 2

__Short answer.__ A statistically significant result with a small sample does not imply the same conclusion with a larger sample.

__Explanation.__ It's easy to assume that you would find significant results with a larger sample if you found a significant result with a smaller sample. However, a smaller sample also means a larger standard error which increases the likelihood of observing unusual values. That is, the significant result from a smaller sample can be a result of randomness and you may not observe the same result with a larger sample. Simmons, Nelson,, and Simonsohn demonstrated this with a simulation shown on the right.

## Example answers to question 3

```{r include=FALSE}
pa3 <- pwr::pwr.t.test(
  d = 5/4.78, sig.level = 0.05, 
  power = 0.8, type = "two.sample")
```

We can repeat the calculation using 5 pg/ml instead of 2 pg ml for the desired effect size. The same R function now indicates a minimum sample size of `r ceiling(pa3$n) * 2`. When you expect a bigger difference, it's easier to detect the difference and requires smaller sample to achieve the same statistical power.
