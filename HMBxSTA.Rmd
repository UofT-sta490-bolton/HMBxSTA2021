# Land Acknowledgement

Though we are meeting together online, let us begin by acknowledging the land that brings us together as members of the U of T community. The land on which our University operates is the traditional lands of the Anishinaabe, the Haudenosaunee and the Missisaugas of the Credit. With the Dish With One Spoon Wampum these peoples agreed to share and protect this land, and all those who have come here since, both Indigenous and non-Indigenous, are invited into this treaty in a spirit of respect and peace.

Today we come together to discuss statistics and human biology, two fields that have been part of historical and ongoing colonization,  oppression and harm of Indigenous peoples. Let us take this moment to remind ourselves of our responsibilities to this land, its original peoples, and to each other and work to be ethical and culturally competent practitioners in our chosen fields.

## Learning outcomes

.pull-left[
###STA
By the end of this session, STA students will have:

- Practiced active listening
- Practiced asking appropriate questions to elicit information needed for providing statistical advice
- Experienced what a short-term consulting appointment is like
- Practiced providing advice on statistical considerations and methods
]

.pull-right[
### HMB
By the end of this session, HMB students will have:

- Practiced explaining their research to a non-HMB student
- Practiced asking questions to clarify technical advice received
- Increased their exposure to statistical ‘traps’ to look out for in research

# Case study

.header[<u>[Go to plan](#plan)</u>]

## Methods

Note: The Subject, Task and Design sections are reproduced from the original poster. The Analysis component has been simplified slightly

__Subject.__ One mature Atlantic Salmon (Salmo salar) participated in the fMRI study.
The salmon was approximately 18 inches long, weighed 3.8 lbs, and was not alive at
the time of scanning.

__Task.__ The task administered to the salmon involved completing an open-ended
mentalizing task. The salmon was shown a series of photographs depicting human
individuals in social situations with a specified emotional valence. The salmon was
asked to determine what emotion the individual in the photo must have been
experiencing.

__Design.__ Stimuli were presented in a block design with each photo presented for 10
seconds followed by 12 seconds of rest. A total of 15 photos were displayed. Total
scan time was 5.5 minutes.

### Analysis

.small[Source: http://prefrontal.org/files/posters/Bennett-Salmon-2009.pdf]

---
### GLM results (initial)

"A t-contrast was used to test for regions with significant BOLD signal change
during the photo condition compared to rest. The parameters for this
comparison were t(131) > 3.15, p(uncorrected) < 0.001, 3 voxel extent
threshold.

Several active voxels were discovered in a cluster located within the salmon’s
brain cavity (Figure 1, see above). The size of this cluster was 81 mm3 with a
cluster-level significance of p = 0.001. Due to the coarse resolution of the
echo-planar image acquisition and the relatively small size of the salmon
brain further discrimination between brain regions could not be completed.
Out of a search volume of 8064 voxels a total of 16 voxels were significant."

### Controlling for the false discovery rate

Identical t-contrasts controlling the false discovery rate (FDR) and familywise
error rate (FWER) were completed. These contrasts indicated no active
voxels, even at relaxed statistical thresholds (p = 0.25).
