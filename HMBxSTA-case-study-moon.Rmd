## Method

Note: The following sections are reproduced from the original paper.

__Subjects.__ 42 participants (all live) were randomly assigned to the high-power-pose or low-power-pose condition.  

__Task.__ The experimenter placed an electrode on the participants and explained "To test accuracy of physiological responses as a function of sensor placement relative to your heart, you are being put into a certain physical position." The experimenter then manually configured participants' bodies. The participants held the two poses for 1 minute each completing a filler task.

__Measurement.__ Standard salivary-hormone collection procedures were used to collect saliva samples before and after the power-pose task. Testosterone, a hormone that increases dominant behaviours, levels were measured in pg/ml.

---
## Method

Note: The following analysis and values have been modified to simplify the case study.

__Analysis.__ A two sample t-test assuming a common variance for both groups was conducted to test whether the _mean difference in testosterone_ among the high-power-pose group was _different_ from that among the low-power-pose group. 

__Result.__ The 0.05 significance level hypothesis test found a significant result of 2.34 pg/ml mean difference (pooled sd: 4.78) in testosterone level.

# Discussion Questions

1. Did the study have enough subjects? What is the minimum number of subjects you would recommend? Discuss any assumptions.

2. If you were to conduct the same experiment again with a larger group of participants, say 250, do you expect to find a statistically significant result again? Explain.

3. Now suppose any difference testosterone level less than 5 pg/ml<sup>&#8224;</sup> is not sufficient to change one's behaviour or otherwise clinically meaninful. What is the minimum number of subjects under this new assumption? Assume all other assumptions from Q1 hold.

.small[<sup>&#8224;</sup>This values is an arbitrary value selected for the purpose of the case study.]

## Example answers to question 1

```{r include=FALSE}
pa1 <- pwr::pwr.t.test(
  d = 2/4.78, sig.level = 0.05, 
  power = 0.8, type = "two.sample")
pa1
```

__Assumptions.__ Suppose the researchers wanted at least 80% statistical power to capture a difference of 2 pg/ml or more. That is, they wanted to ensure that if there was in deed a true difference of 2 pg/ml between the two groups then the experiment would detect and conclude a significant difference with a probability of 80%. Futher assume the observed standard deviation is a good estimate for the true standard deviation.

__Power analysis.__ Using at 5% significance level, we can conduct a power analysis to compute the required sample size in R as shown on the right. Based on the result, it's recommended to recruit at least `r ceiling(pa1$n)` participants per treatment, or `r ceiling(pa1$n) * 2` in total.

## Example answers to question 2

.pull-left[

__Short answer.__ A statistically significant result with a small sample does not imply the same conclusion with a larger sample.

__Explanation.__ It's easy to assume that you would find significant results with a larger sample if you found a significant result with a smaller sample. However, a smaller sample also means a larger standard error which increases the likelihood of observing unusual values. That is, the significant result from a smaller sample can be a result of randomness and you may not observe the same result with a larger sample. Simmons, Nelson,, and Simonsohn demonstrated this with a simulation shown on the right.

## Example answers to question 3

```{r include=FALSE}
pa3 <- pwr::pwr.t.test(
  d = 5/4.78, sig.level = 0.05, 
  power = 0.8, type = "two.sample")
```

.pull-left[

We can repeat the calculation using 5 pg/ml instead of 2 pg ml for the desired effect size. The same R function now indicates a minimum sample size of `r ceiling(pa3$n) * 2`. When you expect a bigger difference, it's easier to detect the difference and requires smaller sample to achieve the same statistical power.
